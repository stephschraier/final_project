Brief description of app: Our app is an app to rent fitness equipment. With the covid pandemic many gyms have had to either close or seen decreased membership, and many former gym goers have had to switch to at home workouts. There is also a shortage of fitness equipment available for purchase, and what is available comes at a high cost. Our app is designed to solve this two way problem by allowing at home fitness folks to rent underutilized equipment from their local gyms. For the final, our project will be geared for the fitness equipment users, not the gyms. It will be prepopualted with all of the equipment that is available to rent.
